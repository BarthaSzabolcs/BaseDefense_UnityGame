# BaseDefense - Unity Game (2018.09.13. - 2018.12.05.)

School project work, where our team wanted to make a small game. There were no clear requirments, so the game is not the best, but it has a lot of work put in to it, and I were really proud to it at the time! :D
Most of the work, including design, artwork, system architecture and programming were done by me (Bartha Szabolcs).
